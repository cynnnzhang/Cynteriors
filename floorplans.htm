	<h2>Step 1: Opening the Application</h2>
	<a class="link" href="https://roomplanner3d.planningwiz.com/" target="_blank" >Click here to go to PlanningWiz</a>
	<p>Once you open the software, you will be given options like opening a saved design, uploading a floor plan, etc. But in this tutorial I will be showing you how to <strong><i>start from scratch!</i></strong></p>

	<h2>Step 2: Creating your Room</h2> 
	<p> Start by using the <strong><i> Draw Room </i></strong> function in the tool bar to create your room. If you wish, you may change the dimensions of the walls. Next, you can create the flooring for the room using the <strong><i> Draw Floor </i></strong> function and pinning the four corners. Double click when you are done drawing to end it. </p>

	<p> To change the colour or texture of your flooring, click the floor, then click the little paintbrush in the top right corner. There you will find different textures, like parquet, tile, carpet, color, etc. Choose whatever texture you like and drag it into the main square in the upper right.</p>

	<h2>Step 3: Inserting Elements</h2>
	<p> The left column is filled with options for furniture, floors, doors and windows, and there are also predefined plans if you don't want to start bare bones.</p>

	<h2>Step 4: Viewing your Design</h2>
	<p> There are 5 viewing modes: <strong><i> 2D, 3D, Animate, Walkthrough, and PIP. 3D is the base mode while the others are additional (Except PIP).</i></strong></p>
	<p> <strong><i>3D View</strong></i>: Will allow you to view in 3D. Use the zoom and arrow functions on the right to move around and view from different angles. </p>
	<p> <strong><i>Animate 3D View</strong></i>: This mode will rotate your room in 3D automatically.</p>
	<img src="images/four.png" width="1000">
	<p><strong><i>Walkthrough 3D View</strong></i>: This mode will allow you to essentially "walk through" your room from a humans view point. Press Esc button to escape.</p>
	<img src="images/five.png" width="1000">
	<p><strong><i>PIP (Picture-in-picture) 3D View</strong></i>: This mode will allow you to edit in 2D, while also viewing the 3D version in a small window.</p>
