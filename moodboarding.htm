<h2><strong>KEY IDEA: Visualising your Space</strong></h2>
<p>Moodboards are made up of different images, materials, and text, and are a great way to visualize the concept and style of your room. 
For those looking ahead to a career in interior design, mood boards are especially great to convey your project to a client. </p>

<h3>ELEMENTS</h2>
<p> I love how interior design can embody feelings brought to you by your surroundings. Everyone's different and I encourage you to design your living spaces to fit the vibe you want to feel at home.
Moodboards really aid in pulling together all the elements to create a cohesive vibe. </p>

	<h4> COLOUR PALETTE </h4>
	<p> This is a simple one. Warm or cool? Neutral or bold? Primary or secondary? Complimenting or contrasting? </p>
	<h4> ACCENTS </h4>
	<p> Accents bring uniqueness and boldness to a space. I personally like a pop of a bright color or a rough texture to bring personality into rooms. Shapes, textures, colour, and lighting can all be accents that will bring dynamism into a room. </p>
	<h4> TEXTURES AND TEXTILES</h4>
	<p> Textures can be a part of your accents but also add another layer to plain hues. Adding textiles like faux leather, faux fur, wood, glass, ceramic, and metal add personality to a space.</p>
	<h4> SHAPES </h4>
	<P>Another accent, but can also be used throughout. Fun, swirly shapes contribute to a unique look, straight edges to a minimalist look, patterns and mandalas to a boho look, and triangles for an edgy look.</p>

	<h3> How? </h3>
	<h2>Pinterest Boards</h2>
	<p>  I highly recommend Pinterest as a platform for easy inspiration! By searching up a few key words, you can find pictures with the type of design you're envisioning, and pin it to a board. Below is my bedroom board, and another one I found on the website. </p>

	<h2>Houzz</h2>
	<p>  Houzz is another great platform. It is more proffessional than Pinterest and has multiple capabilities. You can create Ideabooks (Find mine below), connect with proffessionals, purchase items, and so much more!</p>
